        You turn on your location services and place a bin where you feel there should be dustbin.
        \n\nThe pinned data from all users is collected at out servers where it is aggregated and stored.
        \n\nAs more bins are placed the app will recommend places to set up dustbins which will
          ultimately prevent litter.
        \n\nHope you see a lot of bins!
